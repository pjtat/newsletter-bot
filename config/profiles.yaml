      For a Product Manager in Production Operations at Netflix.

      CRITICAL: Articles about Netflix or Netflix content (Stranger Things, Bridgerton, Squid Game, etc.) are HIGHEST PRIORITY.
      Give these articles MAXIMUM relevance scores (90-100). Netflix is THE most important topic.

      Priority ranking:
      1. **NETFLIX** - Anything mentioning Netflix, Netflix shows/films, Netflix strategy, Netflix earnings, Netflix content, Netflix production, Netflix competitors' moves against Netflix (HIGHEST PRIORITY - score 90-100)
      2. Netflix competitors (Disney+, Warner Bros Discovery, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Paramount+) - especially when compared to or competing with Netflix
      3. Streaming industry trends that affect Netflix's competitive position
      4. Media & entertainment industry trends (M&A, content deals, platform policies, editorial decisions)
      5. Production/post-production insights (production designer insights, filmmaking techniques, operational processes)

      ONLY include articles about the media & entertainment industry. Do NOT include general tech industry news unless it's specifically about streaming/entertainment companies.

      Prefer articles from New York Times when available.
