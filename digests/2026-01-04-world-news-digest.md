## Executive Summary

The United States has dramatically escalated its foreign policy approach this week with a stunning military intervention in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in "Operation Absolute Resolve" while President Trump declares America will "run" the country until a safe transition occurs. The unprecedented action has drawn mixed reactions from world leaders and left Venezuelans grappling with uncertainty about their nation's future under temporary U.S. control. Meanwhile, Trump's aggressive domestic agenda is reshaping America's social fabric, with sweeping immigration restrictions creating visible impacts across hospitals, communities, and Main Streets nationwide, while a troubling wave of anti-Indian sentiment is forcing one of America's most successful immigrant communities to question their place in the country. The week's events signal a stark shift toward unilateral American action both abroad and at home, as traditional diplomatic partnerships strain—evidenced by the unraveling U.S.-Ukraine relationship—while Trump pursues what he characterizes as decisive solutions to complex geopolitical challenges.
