## Executive Summary

A dramatic week in international affairs was dominated by the U.S. military's successful capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in "Operation Absolute Resolve," a tactically precise mission that extracted the controversial leader from his fortified compound in Caracas without American casualties. President Trump celebrated the operation as "brilliant" while facing questions about congressional authorization and legal justification, as world leaders expressed mixed reactions to the unprecedented strike on Venezuelan soil. The capture has energized Venezuelan-American communities who gathered to celebrate what many see as a pivotal moment for regime change, though the operation raises significant questions about U.S. foreign policy precedents. Meanwhile, tensions continue to simmer in other international relationships, with reports emerging of fractures in the U.S.-Ukraine partnership as competing White House and Pentagon factions have complicated America's support for the war effort. Domestically, a troubling rise in anti-Indian sentiment is challenging one of America's most successful immigrant communities, highlighting growing ethnic tensions within the country.
